# computer-vision-smart-interaction
The Computer Vision for Smart Interaction project enables real-time object detection using YOLOv8 and a Flask backend, with a React frontend for user interaction. Users can upload images through the web interface, and the system processes them, detecting objects and displaying bounding boxes.
